Characteristics of DTOs:
Data Carrier: DTOs serve as simple data containers that carry data between different parts of an application.
Structure: They are plain Java objects or POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) that contain fields with getters and setters to hold data.
No Business Logic: They donâ€™t contain business logic; their sole purpose is to transfer data.
Customized Data: DTOs contain only the necessary data required for specific operations or interactions between layers.
Encapsulation: They help in encapsulating and abstracting the internal data structures (such as database entities) from the external layers (like API consumers).
Immutability: DTOs can be immutable (fields are set once and not changed), ensuring that transferred data remains consistent.
